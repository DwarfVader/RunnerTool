# RunnerTool

This tool helps to organize/visualize trips of a runner for several senders to several destinations on a given date. It displays the (next) destination of the currently executed trip with all of its visit purposes to be satisfied. If visit purposes cannot be satisfied, the user can abandon it, whereupon it gets automatically added to the next trip as soon as one gets created. 
The use can manage lists of senders, destinations and vacations (of destinations). 

This project came in my mind while I worked as a runner. It aimed at gaining experience in WPF with MVVM. 

Currently, storing stuff to a database is not supported.
